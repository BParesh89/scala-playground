3. Functional programming is a style of programming that emphasizes writing applications using only pure functions and immutable values.
   What is a pure function ?
   
   a. The input solely determines the output.
   
      Impure function
      
       var a= 5
       def func(i:Int):Int = {return a + i}  // uses external variable a. 
       
      Pure function
      
       def func(i:Int, a:Int):Int = {return a+i}   // doesn't uses any external variable
   b. The function doesn't change its input values.
   
   c. There are no side effects, this means the function only do whatever it is intended for. It doesn't do anything extra.
